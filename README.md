# The Philip Bramley Designs Website

My project was designed for Philip Bramley who is a jewellery designer. This website is a site that will give us an insight into Philip Bramley the Jewellery Designer.

The opening page of my project gives us a brief history about Philip and were he studied and trained over the years, which gives us a view into the amount of experience and talent he has. Also the image on top of every page
shows Philip working on a piece of jewellery at his work station so who ever clicks on his webpage will have a visual to show them what it is about.

## UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Tech Used

* Cloud9
  * This was the software that I used to write the html, css and Readme files.
  * It was used to store all the images and videos.
   
* HTML 
  * This was used to create the mark up language.
   
* CSS
  * milestone-project-1/assets/css/styles.css
    * CSS was used to style the elements of the HTML code.
 
* Bootstrap
  * href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css
    * This was used to help style the website and the grid system layout of it.

  * A [CSS checker](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) was used to check the stylings.

The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
