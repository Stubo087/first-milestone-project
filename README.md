# The Philip Bramley Designs Website

My project was designed for Philip Bramley who is a jewellery designer. This website is a site that will give us an insight into Philip Bramley the Jewellery Designer. It will show case Philip himself and the work that he can do with old and new jewellery.

The opening page of my project .

## UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

## Tech Used

* Cloud9
  * This was the software that I used to write the html, css and Readme files.
  * It was used to store all the images and videos.
   
* HTML 
  * This was used to create the mark up language.
   
* CSS
  * milestone-project-1/assets/css/styles.css
    * CSS was used to style the elements of the HTML code.
 
* Bootstrap
  * href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css
    * This was used to help style the website and the grid system layout of it.

* Font Awesome
  * https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.1/css/all.css
  * https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,200,300,400,500|Exo:100,200,300,400
  * https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Aguafina+Script&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    * These were used to create a universal font for the website.

* Hover
  * https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js
    * This was used to have the hover styles run smoothly

* Validators
  * An [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) was used to check the code.
  * A [CSS checker](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) was used to check the stylings.

The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

I started writing the code in this repositorie and then started trying out different things in another [Repositorie](https://github.com/Stubo087/navbar.git) and ended up doing most of the coding their.
I copied and pasted all of my work across to this repositorie to finish.

### index.html

* Go to home page
  * Click on the Facebook link at the top of page, make sure it opens link on a new page and goes to Philips facebook page
  * Scroll down and make sure everything is in the right place
  * Repeat this on different browsers

### designs.html

* Images
  * Go to Designs page
  * Click on each image and make sure it opens to a larger image
  * Repeat this process on each image
  * Scroll down, click on the contact fontawesome image, make sure it redirects you to the contact page

### repair.html

* Repair Service
  * Go to Repair Service page
  * Make sure that the video plays when you go to the page

###  contact.html

* Contact Form
  * Go to Contact Us page
  * Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
  * Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
  * Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears

### Navigation and Footer

* Navigation
  * Try out each menu item on each page respectively
  * Make sure they lead to the correct place and can easily find your way back to starting point
  * Get another person to test this out for you
* Footer
  * Download
    * Click the down load icon and make sure that a price list opens on a new page
    * Get another person to test this out for you
  * Social Media links
    * Click each link to make sure they open in another page
    * The only one working was facebook because Philip is still setting up the other Social media accounts and when they are done I can link them to the Icons

## Mobile Responsive

* Each page was checked by using the Inspect tool on the browser and then choosing the different screen sizes to mack sure that the page reduce accordingly
* The HTML code was put through a validator every so often to make sure that it worked ok


You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

In Cloud9 I deployed my project by pushing it in terminal window ( in bash ) to my Github repository named milestone-project-1 via the command line.  Each time an edit was done I would save it to my [GitHub](https://github.com/Stubo087/first-milestone-project.git)
My GitHub page was built from the Master Branch.

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).


In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
