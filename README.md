# The Philip Bramley Designs Website

My project was designed for Philip Bramley who is a jewellery designer. This website is a site that will give us an insight into Philip Bramley the Jewellery Designer. 
It will show case Philip himself and the work that he can do with old and new jewellery.

The opening page of my project gives us a brief history about Philip and were he studied and trained over the years, which gives us a view into the amount of experience and talent he has. Also the image on top of every page
shows Philip working on a piece of jewellery at his work station so who ever clicks on his webpage will have a visual to show them what it is about.
On the Designs page we get to see how a piece of jewellerey is made step by step. Repair page goes through all of the work that can be done by Philip and a video showing us aswell. On the footer there is a downloadable price
list which gives customers an idea of what a repair is going to cost them. The last page is where people can get in contact with him and enquire about work they want done.

## UX

This website is for people that are interested in getting there old jewellery redesigned into a new piece of jewellery or looking to get a bespoke piece of jewellery made. This website allows the customer tp see who he is and what
he can do. It also gives the customer a visual experience with pictures and a video of him doing the work. The contact page allows customers to get in contact with him direct about work they want done or just a question about a piece of jewellery that they have.
In the footer of every page there is a downloadable price list and links to his social pages where customers can see the work that he is working on at the moment.

## Tech Used

* Balsamiq
  * This was used to do the mockups for the web page.

* Cloud9
  * This was the software that I used to write the html, css and Readme files.
  * It was used to store all the images and videos.
   
* HTML 
  * This was used to create the mark up language.
   
* CSS
  * milestone-project-1/assets/css/styles.css
    * CSS was used to style the elements of the HTML code.
 
* Bootstrap
  * href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css
    * This was used to help style the website and the grid system layout of it.

* Font Awesome
  * https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.1/css/all.css
  * https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,200,300,400,500|Exo:100,200,300,400
  * https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Aguafina+Script&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    * These were used to create a universal font for the website.

* Hover
  * https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js
    * This was used to have the hover styles run smoothly

* Validators
  * An [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) was used to check the code.
  * A [CSS checker](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) was used to check the stylings.

The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

I started writing the code in this repositorie and then started trying out different things in another [Repositorie](https://github.com/Stubo087/navbar.git) and ended up doing most of the coding their.
I copied and pasted all of my work across to this repositorie to finish.
